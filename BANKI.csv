What are the differences between ES6 class and ES5 function constructors?,"<div>ES6 Class constructors are similar to classes in other languages, in that they create objects in a blueprint. The syntax is familiar to other OOP oriented programming languages, and I find it much similar than function constructors.</div><div>Where ES5 function constructors create objects along with inheritance property. Not all browsers support ES6.&nbsp;</div>","""<br> <a href=""""http://resource.com""""></a>  """
Can you offer a use case for the new arrow =&gt; function syntax? How does this new syntax differ from other functions?,"<div>The main benefit is that arrow functions aren’t bound by this keyword, so it’ll lexically go upa&nbsp; scope and use the value of this in the scope which is defined. So that’s really useful for ES6 React Components, to stop this.state from returning undefined.&nbsp;</div><div>I also like them because I feel they’re more readable in code.</div>","""<br> <a href=""""http://resource.com""""></a>  """
What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?,"The main advantage is the value of this gets set at the time of the function creation. Especially for ES6 React.Components, which doesn’t auto bind methods so one super common issue is for this.state returns undefined.&nbsp;","""<br> <a href=""""http://resource.com""""></a>  """
What is the definition of a higher-order function?,A higher order function takes a function as an argument or returns a function. Some really common examples would be .map() and .filter() both are higher order functions that take functions as arguments.&nbsp;,"""<br> <a href=""""http://resource.com""""></a>  """
Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?,"<div>You do this all the time in React, especially with props. Imagine you passed into a child components props that contain two different objects. Everything you had to access the code, you’d have to use syntax like props.objName.property and that can be messy and listing props itself every time can be rather redundant.<br><br></div><div>We can destructure props to be ( { ObjectOne, ObjectTwo } ), so we could use the objects directly without having to reference props.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>I also do this a lot by destructuring out the irrelevant API information.&nbsp;</div>","""<br> <a href=""""http://resource.com""""></a>  """
"ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?",<div>I really like how it can evaluate expressions in template literals.&nbsp;</div><div>Such as&nbsp;</div><div>`1 + 2 is ${1 + 2}` or `Hello ${firstName || unknown}`</div><div>But namely it just looks a lot cleaner than string concatenation when you have a ton of variables.</div>,"""<br> <a href=""""http://resource.com""""></a>  """
Can you give an example of a curry function and why this syntax offers an advantage?,"<div>Currying takes a function that takes multiple arguments and transforms it into a sequence of multiple functions that take one argument.

What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?,"""<div>The difference is that spread syntax <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">spreads</span> the elements of an array or object <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">into individual variables</span>, whereas rest syntax <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">condenses </span>individual variables and puts them <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">into an array or object</span>.<br><br></div><div>Spread: Array elements are used as arguments individually</div><div><br></div><div>const myArray = [4, 2, 9];<br><div>function printNum(a, b, c, d) {</div><div>&nbsp;console.log(a, b, c, d);&nbsp;</div>}<br>printNum(...myArray, 'x'); // 4, 2, 9, 'x'</div><div>Also useful for joining objects together (only one layer deep though, no nested objects will be transferred)&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Rest:</div><div>Accepts a variable amount of arguments for a function.

How can you share code between files?,"Sharing code is done with modules, they can be thought of as a container that holds related code which can then be exported to another file.

Why you might want to create static class members?,"<div>Static members (properties and methods) are called without instantiating their class and can’t be called through a class instance.&nbsp;</div><div>For static methods, they’re used to create utility functions for an application.
