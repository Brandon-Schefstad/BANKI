What is a Linked List?,"A linked list is a linear data structure, where the elements aren’t stored at contiguous memory locations. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains the data and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. Some benefits to this creation and deletion are generally more expensive with arrays. As everything has to be moved if an index was deleted. Downside you can’t randomly Access a value in a Linked List, and it requires more memory space.","""<br> <a href=""""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/"""">Linked List Data Structure</a> <br> <a href=""""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-vs-array/"""">Linked List vs Array</a> """
What is a Doubly Linked List?,"<div>Compared to a Linked List, a doubly Linked List includes a previous pointer, which saves a reference to the memory location of the previous node.
