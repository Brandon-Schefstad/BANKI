What does a doctype do?	The DOCTYPE declaration is used to tell what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. The most common version of this is <!DOCTYPE html> for the HTML5 standards.	Front End Interview Handbook
How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?	To change the language, you can set the lang attribute in the HTML. It won’t change the HTML document, but the browser will be able to identify the language of the HTML document and will translate the page in your preferred language. You can also display alternate language pages based on the user’s location.	
What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?	Definitely word spacing. You can’t always use the same word or phrasing because depending on the language, sentences or words can take more or less space and affect the layout. This also applies to images. You also need to be careful of colors, designs or images that can be perceived as insensitive or offensive in certain languages.	Some tips for designing multilingual sites
What are data- attributes good for?	Data attributes are defined by developers, rather than attributes that are natively built into HTML. Their main usage is so the HTML can communicate with the CSS and JS. You can store information like scores in a game or other information that’d be constantly changing. You can even use attribute selectors to change the CSS based on that as well.	MDN:Using data attributes
Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?	Semantics - Allow you to describe more precisely what your content is. Connectivity - Communicate with the server in new and innovative ways. Offline and storage - Allow webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently. Multimedia -Making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web. 2D/3D graphics and effects - Allowing a more diverse range of presentation options. Performance and integration - Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of Computer Hardware. Device access - Allowing for the usage of various input and output devices. Styling - Letting authors write more sophisticated themes.	MDN - HTML5
Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.	localStorage is client sided, lasts forever, is persistent across browser sessions. sessionStorage is client sided, lasts until you close the tab, and is not persistent across browser sessions. Cookies can be client or server sided, with a manually set expiration time. That expiration time could be anything. Cookies are persistent across browser sessions and sent with every HTTP request.	Using HTTP Cookies Local and Session Storage
Describe the difference between <script>, <script async> and <script defer>.	<script> - HTML parsing is blocked, the script is fetched and executed immediately, HTML parsing resumes after the script is executed. <script async> - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes). Use async when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example, analytics. <script defer> - The script will be fetched parallel to HTML parsing and executed after the page has finished parsing. If there’s multiple deferred scripts, they’re executed in order. For scripts that rely on a fully parsed DOM, deferred scripts can be helpful.	async vs defer attributes Stack Overflow: Script Tag - async and defer Asynchronous vs Deferred JavaScript
Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between <head></head> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?	"<links> in the head allows CSS and HTML to be parsed simultaneously for progressive rendering so there aren’t flashes of unstyled content. <scripts> can throw errors if the DOM isn’t rendered. For example trying to manipulate DOM elements that haven’t been initialized yet. You can put scripts in the head by deferring it so it runs after the DOM is loaded. An exception for positioning of <script>s at the bottom is when your script contains document.write(), but these days it's not a good practice to use document.write()"	Put Stylesheets at the Top
What is progressive rendering?	Progressive rendering are techniques to improve the performance of a webpage by rendering content to display as quickly as possible. Such as loading only the relevant/on screen images when the user scrolls. And prioritizing visible content first and the bare minimum CSS/JS needed for those. Some examples of this would be: Lazy loading of images – images on the page aren’t loaded all at once. JavaScript only loads when the user scrolls into the part that displays the image. Prioritizing visible content - Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the page that’d be rendered in the user’s browser to display as quickly as possible. You’d then use the deferred scripts or listen for DOMContentLoaded to load in other resources and content.	Async Fragments: Rediscovering Progressive HTML Rendering What is progressive rendering?
Why you would use a srcset attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.	You’d use the srcset to serve different images to users based on their device display width. For example you can display higher quality images to devices with retina display, while serving lower resolution images to lower-end devices. This will increase performance and decrease data wastage.	Responsive images Responsive Images
Have you used different HTML templating languages before?	In 100Devs we use EJS to template our HTML dynamically depending on the data being served. There are many more out there such as ERB, Slim, Handlebars, Liquid, etc. provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. Most templating engines will also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you need custom processing before display.	
What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?	Specificity is how browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant and applied. CSS is cascading so it’s applied top to bottom, but it can only override existing styles if the selector specificity is equal or greater than previous CSS. The weight of the specificity is based on how specific the selector is. For example, elements have a weight of 1, classes a weight of 10, ids a weight of 100 and inline css or !important declarations have a weight of 1000. These values are all additive.	CSS Specificity
"What's the difference between ""resetting"" and ""normalizing"" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?"	Every browser has in-built CSS by default. And that’s not always desirable because you can have CSS elements that conflict or aren’t intended, which can cause some headaches debugging later. A CSS reset is used to undo any of that browser applied CSS, where a CSS normalize is like a reset but maintains some default styling among browsers. I generally prefer a CSS reset because I prefer the fresh slate, but I’ve worked with developers that prefer CSS normalize because they’re more used to the default styling.	Difference between “resetting” and “normalizing” in CSS
Describe floats and how they work.	The float property removes an element from the normal flow of the page and places it in either the left or right side of the container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. Floats are typically for floating images inside of blocks of text, especially after flexbox and grid took its place.	MDN: Float
Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.	Z-index relates to the z-axis, or what elements are stacked on top of each other. Z-index is 0 by default. In order to assign a Z-index you MUST have a position other than ‘static’ declared. Z-index is also relative to the stacking context, which by default is shared by the entire document. To create a new stacking context on a parent it must have a position and declared Z-index value OR have an opacity < 1.	MDN: z-index
Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.	"Block formatting context is a process that occurs in the rendering of a web page. It determines where the boxes are laid out. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block."	Block Formatting Contexts in CSS
What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?	"Elements with ""clear: "" will appear beneath a floated element, rather than next to them. Clear: none Clear: Left Clear: right (or both)"	MDN: clear
Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.	Websites often deal with tons of images, but a lot of image requests add up and reduces the performance of your website. So instead of having to load a ton of images, you can sprite images by quilting together multiple images into one large image. This way multiple image requests can become a singular HTTP request. Then in the CSS you use background-position and background-repeat:no repeat to shift the background underneath so different sections are revealed. Commonly used for icons.	An Easy Guide to CSS Sprites
How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?	If it’s only one browser, then I’d consider a separate stylesheet for that browser in particular. If I’m using bootstrap, then that has some libraries that can help fix browser specific styling issues. Beyond that I’d probably consider using a CSS Reset/Normalize depending on the styling issue.	
How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?	Graceful degradation — The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers. Progressive enhancement — The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it. caniuse.com or Modernizr can also work	MDN: Graceful degradation MDN: Progressive Enhancement
What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?	"Avoid using visibility:hidden and display:none as most screen-readers skip over this content. Generally for screen-readers you’d want to use the CSS class for only screen readers (typically '.sr-only' but name doesn’t matter). The following CSS will place it off-screen and hide the content inside."	Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users
Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?	I’ve used both CSS Grid and Flexbox. Often I’ll be using both. CSS Grid for the outer layout of the webpage so you can build a complex responsive design, and flexbox for aligning the content and moving blocks. If I had to pick one I prefer flexbox, but flexbox can’t do everything grid does and grid can’t do everything flexbox does. So it’s really just what tool is most relevant for the issue on hand.	Kevin Powell- CSS Grid Learn CSS Grid Kevin Powell: Learn flexbox the easy way CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet
Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?	A popular philosophy is to use mobile-first design, where the website is formatted for viewing on a phone and then media queries are used for larger screen sizes.	What is Mobile First Design?
Are you familiar with styling SVG?	SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a series of instructions that tell a web browser what each image looks like. Especially since more and more people are using devices with Retina screens, SVG are important to avoid pixelation of images. Depending on the SVG, it’ll have different geometry properties, like cx/cy or rx/ry, height/width. They have some shared CSS, like the fill property, font properties, etc.	Styling SVG with CSS
Can you give an example of an @media property other than screen?	Most common are: all — for all media typesprint — for printersscreen — for computer screens, tablets and, smart-phonesspeech — for screen readers that “read” the page out loud	7 Media types Media Query CSS Tutorial
"What are some of the ""gotchas"" for writing efficient CSS?"	"Shorter selectors are always ideal when possible. Avoid tag (div{}) and universal (*{})selectors as they match a large amount of elements. Ensure media queries are more specific than the base styling or they won't change the element. Avoid using shorthands (padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px) if possible. Causes issues with overlapping declarations."	
What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?	The main advantage is flexibility. Having access to variables and functions makes development much easier and results in a lot more readable CSS. Preprocessers can also create browser-specific CSS (webkit, moz-) automatically. As well being able to separate CSS in multiple files without worrying about extra HTTP requests. However, CSS preprocessors generally increase file size, and can take a long time to compile. There may also be errors in the compiling itself that can be difficult to debug. Those are the main disadvantages.	
Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.	[Personal answer, edit here]	10 CSS Preprocessors Worth Considering
How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?	Web Design Comps (Comprehensives) are mockups for clients and web designers to get a clear consensus idea of what the website looks. If using @font-faces fonts can be downloaded when the page is accessed. I’d also look into web-safe fonts and how that could change the mockup to ensure that there’s workable fallbacks.	How to Add Non-Standard Fonts to a Website
Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.	The browser starts at the rightmost selector and traverses up the parent elements to determine a match for multiple selectors. So for <p> <span> it first searches for all <span> in a page and then searches for <p> to confirm if it matches or not.	Why do browsers match CSS selectors from right to left?
Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.	They help style parts of the div/text. The browser acts as if a whole new HTML element is added to the markup. Can be used for clearfixes, help with spacing, or decorate the first letter/line like a fancy book. MUST have a “content” property.	::before / ::after
Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.	The box model is the perspective that everything in CSS has a box around it. It’s the content area defined by the width. Different browsers all have their own way on how to render those boxes and what should be included in the “content” area.	The CSS Box Model
What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?	The main advantage is you can specify dimensions of your elements without having to do any major calculations. It essentially counts the border in the width of the box itself. With border-box, the following is 100px wide. -- width: 100px; border: 2px solid black; -- Without border-box, it would be 102px wide and could mess up layout.	box-sizing
What is the CSS display property and can you give a few examples of its use?	The display CSS property sets whether an element is a block or inline element. It also sets the layout for the children of said element. So there’s inline-block, block, inline, table, etc for the layout of an element on a page. There’s also display: flex, for the flex-boxes, where you can align-items and justify-content to influence the spacing of children elements. Some others include: display: inherit for inheriting the parent display property, display: initial, display: grid and display:none, etc	MDN: display
"What's the difference between inline and inline-block?"	Inline elements allow elements to sit on their left and right along with their margins and padding. But they don’t respect the top/bottom margins/padding. Inline elements cannot have a height or a width.Typically text. Where inline-blocks differ is that inline-blocks do respect top/bottom margins and padding. AND they also respect height and width.	CSS display: inline vs inline-block
"What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?"	Static is the default for every page element, meaning it’ll flow into the page normally. Relative means relative to itself, it needs other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom, right) to shift its position from where it’d normally be (with static). It’d also appear above statically positioned elements + have access to z-index. Absolute places any page element exactly where you want it, relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning, while removing it from the flow of the page. A fixed position is relative to the browser window. Imagine like scrolling down on Twitter, you can still see the sidebar regardless of how far down you scroll.	Absolute, Relative, Fixed Positioning: How Do They Differ?
What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change/improve them?	[Personal Answer]	Front End Interview CSS
Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?	"Sample Answer: ""Absolutely, Flexbox solves so many common problems for me. Such as vertically centering elements in a container. Sometimes it’s not all the features are always compatible with certain browsers, like certain versions of Safari is a huge culprit of this. I also use Bootstrap, which is built with Flexbox with a column system. For Grid, if I need to have a column system I’ll use that over Flexbox because Flexbox only positions elements in one dimension."""	CSS Grid vs. Flexbox: Which Should You Use and When?
Can you explain the difference between coding a web site to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?	Important to remember they are not mutually exclusive. The main difference is that a mobile first strategy can be responsive, but a responsive website isn’t always mobile first. Mobile-first designs for phones and its usage, buttons will be larger, hyperlinks are larger, items are spaced further apart to adjust for your thumbs instead of a mouse. Font sizes are bigger on average, etc.	Difference Between Mobile-First and Responsive Web Designs
How is responsive design different from adaptive design?	Responsive design uses one layout and adjusts the content, navigation, and elements of the page to fit the user’s screen. Regardless if it’s viewed on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. Like one key growing/shrinking to match different locks. Adaptive design you have multiple different fixed layouts created that adapt to the user’s screen size depending on the breakpoints. You’d detect the screen size and load the appropriate layout for it. Like a ring of keys for many different locks. Responsive Web Design doesn’t offer as much control as adaptive, but it takes less work to build and maintain. Where adaptive design is more oriented towards retrofitting an existing website.	Adaptive Design vs. Responsive Design
Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?	"Retina means high-resolution with pixel ratio > 1. Most mobile displays are retina displays nowadays. Can make standard resolution images blurry. [Personal Answer] Sample Answer: ""What I do is that if I run into this, I’ll use an alternate high quality image that might be like double the dimensions for specifically devices with retina screens."""	Quick Intro: Retina Displays and Graphics
"Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute positioning, or vice-versa? And why?"	Translate is more efficient for smoother animations because it doesn’t trigger a repaint or reflow, but a composition. Where changing the absolute positioning triggers reflow. Transform causes the browsers to create a GPU layer, but changing an absolute positioning uses the CPU. Also with translate the image still occupies its original space, like as if you were using position relative. Unlike absolute positioning.	Why Moving Elements With Translate() Is Better Than Pos:abs Top/left
CS Theory	Recursion is the process where a function calls itself constantly to solve a problem with the solutions of smaller instances of the same problem. It’ll have a base condition to know when to break out of the recursive loop so it doesn’t cause a stack overflow error. Some examples would be factorials, greatest common divisors, binary trees, linked lists, and so on.	Recursion
What are types?	A data type in programming is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what operations can be applied to it without causing an error. A string for example is a data type for text, and an integer is a data type used to classify whole numbers. You can call the method .split on a string, but not on an integer as that’d cause an error.	
What are data structures?	Data structures ways of organizing data in a computer. It’s a way of arranging data on a computer so it can be accessed and updated efficiently. For example, we can store data in an array which is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. Or a linked list that contains a collection of items with the location in memory to the next node. Stacks, queues, trees, etc.	Data Structures
What is an algorithm?	An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something. Using the proper algorithm for the problem you face is very important as both memory and time is limited. This becomes especially important as datasets become increasingly large. An algorithm with exponential time could take billions of times longer than one with a logarithmic running time.	
What is scope / lexical scope in javascript?	The scope refers to the area where an item (functions or variables) is visible and accessible to other code. The lexical scope is the place in which the item got created.	Lexical Scope in JavaScript – What Exactly Is Scope in JS?
What is polymorphism?	Polymorphism in both OOP and programming, involves function names or operators that work on different things in possibly different ways. Different classes inheriting from the same parent can have the same function with different implementations. As a non-class example, the “+” operator is polymorphic based on what data types it operates on, using different instruction sets at the machine level.	OOP Concepts for Beginners: What is Polymorphism What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used? What is a real life example of polymorphism?
What is encapsulation?	It demands similar data and functions be grouped into like classes/objects. Encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which is the process of hiding all of the secrets of the object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics.	Encapsulation vs Abstraction? Abstraction VS Information Hiding VS Encapsulation
What is a Linked List?	A linked list is a linear data structure, where the elements aren’t stored at contiguous memory locations. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains the data and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. Some benefits to this creation and deletion are generally more expensive with arrays. As everything has to be moved if an index was deleted. Downside you can’t randomly Access a value in a Linked List, and it requires more memory space.	Linked List Data Structure Linked List vs Array
What is a Doubly Linked List?	Compared to a Linked List, a doubly Linked List includes a previous pointer, which saves a reference to the memory location of the previous node. This has several benefits, the traversal can be done in both directions. Deletion of a given node is O(1) as the previous node can be accessed easily, where a linked list requires O(n). A doubly linked list takes more memory, but a doubly linked list is often used to execute heaps, stacks and binary trees.	Difference between Singly linked list and Doubly linked list
What is a Queue	A queue is a linear structure that follows the First in First Out order. In a queue you remove the item that was least recently added. Uses for queues involve anything where you want things to happen in the order that they were called, but the computer can’t keep up to speed. For example a keyboard buffer where you press letters on the keyboard despite the computer being busy.	Queue Data Structure Programming Concepts: Queues
What is a Stack	A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out order. For example think plates stacked over each other at a cafeteria. People take the plate at the top first, with the bottom plate normally staying there the longest amount of time. In programming stacks are often the blocks for function calls or recursive functions. Or for something like an undo function is also a stack.	Stack Data Structure
What is a Hash Table	Hash Tables are basically key/value pairs of data, like a dictionary. JavaScript is unique for hash tables in that objects/classes are a type of hash table. We also have maps that differ slightly but provide similar functionality as a hash table. Hash Tables allow you to store a lot of data and retrieve them very quickly with access being constant time.	JavaScript Hash Table – Associative Array Hashing in JS
What is a Heap	A heap is very similar to a binary search tree. Where it could be a min/max heap. Where the parent node is greater or smaller than the child nodes. The main advantage to heaps over BST is the average time insertion to a heap is constant time vs O(log(n) for a BST. A real world example of a heap are priority queues.	
What is a Trie	A special tree for compactly storing strings where the nodes of a tree store the alphabet. By traversing down the trie, you can check if a value exists and find similar results/words. Some very popular examples for Tries are auto complete, spell checkers, and browser history.	
What is a Tree	A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a value and branches off with its descendants. Some examples of trees are binary search trees, decision tree based learning in machine learning. Databases use tree structures, etc.	
What is a Binary Search Tree	A binary search tree is a data structure where starting from the parent node, nodes on the left are smaller and nodes on the right are larger. This allows for fast lookup, addition and removal of data items. As each comparison skips about half the tree. Making on average an O(log n).	
What is a Disjoint Set	Disjoint Sets are a data structure where sets have no connection to each other. Imagine if we wanted to find a school of 30, which class representative each one had. It’s also called Union-find as you could merge two groups into one set in constant time If group A was merged with group B, you’d only need to update the parent node in order to connect to the two groups together.	
What is a Bloom Filter	A Bloom filter is a data structure used to test if an element is a member of a set. It can let you know with a high chance of being correct if something exists in a group of things. This can help prevent disk reads by querying a bloom filter before checking a database. By running elements through hash functions, those map to array indexes. There can be false positives. But it’ll always know if an element is missing before checking the database.	
Demonstrate Bubble Sort and explain when you might use it?	"Bubble sort sorts the array by comparing two adjacent elements and swaps them if they’re not in the intended order. Therefore values will bubble up the array until they get where they’re supposed to be. As it’s O(n^2) in worst/average case. And O(n) in the best case. There isn't much real life usage. It’s usable for extremely small datasets though."	
Demonstrate Insertion Sort and explain when you might use it?	For insertion sort you: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. Swap the values if the predecessor is greater than the key. You keep swapping it down to index 0 if applicable. Then move onto the next card when no longer applicable. While it has a O(n^2) worse-case time. If the data is nearly sorted or the problem size is small, it’s perfectly reasonable to use insertion sort.	
Demonstrate Merge Sort and explain when you might use it?	Split the given list into two halves. Continue splitting until you’re left with only single element arrays. Merge the subarrays so each subarray is sorted. Repeat step 2 until you end up with a single sorted array. The worst-case time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n), making it one of the fastest sorting algorithms.	
Demonstrate Quicksort and explain when you might use it?	Selects an element of the array as the pivot (usually first or last element) Rearrange the elements so elements smaller of the pivot are on the left, and the right is greater. Equal elements go on either side. Repeat for the left/right sides of the new arrays.	
Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?	JavaScript supports imperative/procedural programming along with Object Oriented Programming and functional programming. JavaScript supports OOP with prototypal inheritance.	
What is functional programming?	So functional programming is a paradigm where you believe that functions are the most important part of your program. In JavaScript functions are primitives, which lends itself extremely well to functional programming. The vast majority of problems are more efficiently solved and abstracted using self contained functions as building blocks. Some examples of functional programming languages are like Haskell, Scala and Lisp.	
What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?	Prototypes work off existing objects that have already been initialized, where you clone them and add stuff to the copies. Where class based inheritance is more like having a blueprint for making objects, defining what it can do and what it contains. Generally in JavaScript classical inheritance is obsolete and there’s very few times where you’d want to use it. Where Prototypal Inheritance is dynamic, you can add new properties and methods after creation.	
What are the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming?	For OOP: It’s easy to understand the basic concept of objects and easy to interpret the meaning of method calls. OOP is also incredibly popular and easy to learn. Objects and behaviors can be tackled together on the same entity, which can be accessed at random by any number of functions with non-deterministic order, causing undesirable behavior like trying to perform two or more operations at the same time. For Functional Programming: Functions tend to be simplified and more generally reusable code compared to OOP. But it can often reduce readability because the code is often more abstract and less concrete.	
What are two-way data binding and one-way data flow, and how are they different?	So two-way data means when the UI field changes, data in the model changes with it and vise versa Where one way data flow means that data always flows in a single direction, only the model has access to change the app’s state. React is a popular example of this, where props which is data coming from the parent is passed down to the child one way. And Angular would be an example of two-way data binding.	
What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?	Asynchronous programming means the engine runs in an event loop. When blocking operations are needed, such as an API request or a timeout call, the request is started. This is important so single threads can handle many operations at once, and operations that are slow or take a lot of time don’t pause the rest of the code.	
What is Node.js? Where can you use it?	JavaScript by design was made to not have file access, so it could only run client side on the browser. Node.js was made to allow web applications to run outside the client’s browser to create server-side/back end web applications.	
Why use Node.js?	It makes building scalable network programs easy. Virtually every single modern website has some form of back end. And with Node we can use JavaScript in the back end for a unified programming language on both front and back end, that’s asynchronous and is generally fast.	
What are the features of Node.js?	All of Node.js library APIs are all asynchronous. It’s single threaded with event looping. It’s highly scalable, and can handle concurrent requests efficiently. It’s cross platform, and open source.	
How do you update NPM to a new version in Node.js?	You can do sudo npm install npm -g, or sudo npm update npm -g. That way you can update npm by using npm itself.	
Why is Node.js Single-threaded?	Node.js is single-threaded for async process. By doing async processing on a single thread under typical web loads, you can achieve more performance and scalability as opposed to thread-based implementation.	
Explain callback in Node.js.	A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents blocking. Node.js is an asynchronous platform, so it heavily relies on callback.	
What is callback hell in Node.js?	"Callback hell is when you have complex nested callbacks, when each callback takes arguments that’s been obtained by the result of previous callbacks. Typically it's unreadable or extremely hard to debug."	
How do you prevent/fix callback hell?	You can typically split callbacks in different functions. That makes them easier to manage and edit. You can also use promises instead, which helps with the readability Or you can convert callbacks to asynchronous functions, then you could write it like it was synchronous code.	
Explain the role of REPL in Node.js.	plain the role of REPL in Node.js. REPL is an interactive shell that processes Node.js . It reads JavaScript code the user enters, evaluates the result, prints the result to the user and loops. It allows you to quickly test and explore JavaScript code within the Node environment without having to store it in a file.	
Name the types of API functions in Node.js.	There’s two types of API functions: The first is Asychronous, Non-blocking functions. When Node.JS makes a request for data to the API, it won’t get blocked till the data is received. The second is Synchronous, Blocking functions. These act blocking functions, where the calling system will wait for a response until the value is returned.	
What are the functionalities of NPM in Node.js?	Node Package Manager provides two main functionalities:It provides access to node.js packages and modules. And it provides command line utility to install the node.js packages, do version management and dependency management.	
What is the difference between Node.js and Ajax?	The difference is that Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is client side, used to update the contents of the page without refreshing it. Where Node.js is server-side JavaScript, for developing server software. For example you wouldn’t want to develop a database system client-side because anyone could access the database credentials, but by doing it in Node.js it gets executed in a server instead of a browser.	
What are “streams” in Node.js? Explain the different types of streams present in Node.js.	Streams are objects that allow developers to read/write data to and from a source continuously. The readable stream is used for read operations. The writable stream is used for write operations. The duplex stream performs both read/write operations. And the transform stream uses input to compute an output.	
Explain chaining in Node.js.	There’s two common types of chaining in Node.js, both parallel chaining and series chaining both in regards to asynchronous functions. The former once all the functions are completed, and if any function returns an arrow, the callback function is fired. And the latter runs only after the previous function is completed. So if anything throws an error, the subsequent functions aren’t executed.	
What are Globals in Node.js?	Node.js global objects are objects that are available in all modules. For example the console is a global object to print errors and output. Where if you mean globals in the namespace, if you define a variable in there, it makes it globally accessible and can be used in any scope.	
What is Event-driven programming?	In Event-driven programming, the flow of the program is determined by user actions, such as mouse clicks, key pressing or message passing. It’s often used for GUIs and web applications that focus on responding to user input. There’s typically a main loop that listens for events and then triggers callback functions whenever one of those events is detected.	
What is Event loop in Node.js work? And How does it work?	The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking input/output despite JavaScript being single-threaded. By offloading operations to the system kernel which is multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. And then the callback will be added to the queue where it’ll eventually be executed.	
What is the purpose of module.exports in Node.js?	Module exports are the instructions that tell Node.js which bits of code to export from a given file so other files can access the exported code. It’s for Modular programming, where you separate the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules to maintain and abstract reusable code.	
What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?	In many cases they’re the same. Some APIs can provide a non-blocking interface a different way, where it’d return an error if it can’t return a value synchronously. So you’d have a non-blocking code without an asynchronous callback.	
What is Tracing in Node.js?	Node.JS tracing is a module that monitors your node applications by recording the time passed to each function. It helps fix memory problems, identify blockages and help identify bugs in your code.	
How will you debug an application in Node.js?	[Personal Answer] Sample Answer: Me personally? I either use console.log, the node.js debugger or ChromeDev Tools. But it depends on the circumstances. I generally prefer the debugger because you can add breakpoints and track the changes of the variable, but it really depends on the scope of what I’m currently working on.	
Difference between setImmediate() vs setTimeout()?	setImmediate() and setTimeout() are similar, but behave in different ways depending on when they are called. setImmediate is very similar to setTimeout with a 0 ms delay. setTimeout() schedules a script to run after a minimum threshold in milliseconds has elapsed. It’ll go to the queue, and run after the stack is empty when the eventloop calls it.	
What is process.nextTick()	So everytime the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick. When you pass a function to process.nextTick() we instruct the engine to invoke this function at the end of the current operation, before the next event loop tick starts. It’s the way we can tell the JS engine to process a function asynchronously but as soon as possible instead of queueing it.	
What is package.json? What is it used for?	Package.json records important metadata about a project and gives that information to npm to identify its dependencies. It can also contain other information such as the project description, version of the project in a distribution, license information, etc.	
What is libuv?	In Node.js, opening a file is asynchronous, and you might have dozens or hundreds file and network operations pending at a time. This is where libuv comes in to help with the file and network operations to figure out “What to do next”. It keeps track of all the outgoing requests and when data comes back it calls the right callback to continue work.	
What are some of the most popular modules of Node.js?	I think the two most commonly used libraries in Node.js would probably be ExpressJS and Mongoose. Express is a framework for Node.js that provides features for web applications. And Mongoose is also a framework that makes it easy to connect an application to a database.	
What is EventEmitter in Node.js?	In JavaScript a lot of user interaction is handled through events, like mouse clicks, keyboard button presses, etc. So on the back end, Node.js allows us to build a similar system with the EventEmitter class where we can add callback functions to execute when an event is triggered. Imagine if you were making a ticket system where you’d want to add it to the database and notify the users, you can add all of them into one listener but also decouple the functions.
