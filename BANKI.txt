What does a doctype do?	The DOCTYPE declaration is used to tell what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. The most common version of this is <!DOCTYPE html> for the HTML5 standards. Read More: Front End Interview Handbook
How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?	To change the language, you can set the lang attribute in the HTML. It won’t change the HTML document, but the browser will be able to identify the language of the HTML document and will translate the page in your preferred language. You can also display alternate language pages based on the user’s location. Read More:
What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?	Definitely word spacing. You can’t always use the same word or phrasing because depending on the language, sentences or words can take more or less space and affect the layout. This also applies to images. You also need to be careful of colors, designs or images that can be perceived as insensitive or offensive in certain languages. Read More: Some tips for designing multilingual sites
What are data- attributes good for?	Data attributes are defined by developers, rather than attributes that are natively built into HTML. Their main usage is so the HTML can communicate with the CSS and JS. You can store information like scores in a game or other information that’d be constantly changing. You can even use attribute selectors to change the CSS based on that as well. Read More: MDN:Using data attributes
Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?	Semantics - Allow you to describe more precisely what your content is. Connectivity - Communicate with the server in new and innovative ways. Offline and storage - Allow webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently. Multimedia -Making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web. 2D/3D graphics and effects - Allowing a more diverse range of presentation options. Performance and integration - Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of Computer Hardware. Device access - Allowing for the usage of various input and output devices. Styling - Letting authors write more sophisticated themes. Read More: MDN - HTML5
Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.	localStorage is client sided, lasts forever, is persistent across browser sessions. sessionStorage is client sided, lasts until you close the tab, and is not persistent across browser sessions. Cookies can be client or server sided, with a manually set expiration time. That expiration time could be anything. Cookies are persistent across browser sessions and sent with every HTTP request. Read More: Using HTTP Cookies Local and Session Storage
Describe the difference between <script>, <script async> and <script defer>.	<script> - HTML parsing is blocked, the script is fetched and executed immediately, HTML parsing resumes after the script is executed. <script async> - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes). Use async when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example, analytics. <script defer> - The script will be fetched parallel to HTML parsing and executed after the page has finished parsing. If there’s multiple deferred scripts, they’re executed in order. For scripts that rely on a fully parsed DOM, deferred scripts can be helpful. Read More: async vs defer attributes Stack Overflow: Script Tag - async and defer Asynchronous vs Deferred JavaScript
Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between <head></head> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?	"<links> in the head allows CSS and HTML to be parsed simultaneously for progressive rendering so there aren’t flashes of unstyled content. <scripts> can throw errors if the DOM isn’t rendered. For example trying to manipulate DOM elements that haven’t been initialized yet. You can put scripts in the head by deferring it so it runs after the DOM is loaded. An exception for positioning of <script>s at the bottom is when your script contains document.write(), but these days it's not a good practice to use document.write() Read More: Put Stylesheets at the Top"
What is progressive rendering?	Progressive rendering are techniques to improve the performance of a webpage by rendering content to display as quickly as possible. Such as loading only the relevant/on screen images when the user scrolls. And prioritizing visible content first and the bare minimum CSS/JS needed for those. Some examples of this would be: Lazy loading of images – images on the page aren’t loaded all at once. JavaScript only loads when the user scrolls into the part that displays the image. Prioritizing visible content - Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the page that’d be rendered in the user’s browser to display as quickly as possible. You’d then use the deferred scripts or listen for DOMContentLoaded to load in other resources and content.

Why you would use a srcset attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.	You’d use the srcset to serve different images to users based on their device display width. For example you can display higher quality images to devices with retina display, while serving lower resolution images to lower-end devices. This will increase performance and decrease data wastage. Read More: Responsive images Responsive Images
Have you used different HTML templating languages before?	In 100Devs we use EJS to template our HTML dynamically depending on the data being served. There are many more out there such as ERB, Slim, Handlebars, Liquid, etc. provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. Most templating engines will also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you need custom processing before display. Read More:
What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?	Specificity is how browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant and applied. CSS is cascading so it’s applied top to bottom, but it can only override existing styles if the selector specificity is equal or greater than previous CSS. The weight of the specificity is based on how specific the selector is. For example, elements have a weight of 1, classes a weight of 10, ids a weight of 100 and inline css or !important declarations have a weight of 1000. These values are all additive. Read More: CSS Specificity
"What's the difference between ""resetting"" and ""normalizing"" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?"	Every browser has in-built CSS by default. And that’s not always desirable because you can have CSS elements that conflict or aren’t intended, which can cause some headaches debugging later. A CSS reset is used to undo any of that browser applied CSS, where a CSS normalize is like a reset but maintains some default styling among browsers. I generally prefer a CSS reset because I prefer the fresh slate, but I’ve worked with developers that prefer CSS normalize because they’re more used to the default styling. Read More: Difference between “resetting” and “normalizing” in CSS
Describe floats and how they work.	The float property removes an element from the normal flow of the page and places it in either the left or right side of the container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. Floats are typically for floating images inside of blocks of text, especially after flexbox and grid took its place. Read More: MDN: Float
Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.	Z-index relates to the z-axis, or what elements are stacked on top of each other. Z-index is 0 by default. In order to assign a Z-index you MUST have a position other than ‘static’ declared. Z-index is also relative to the stacking context, which by default is shared by the entire document. To create a new stacking context on a parent it must have a position and declared Z-index value OR have an opacity < 1. Read More: MDN: z-index
Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.	"Block formatting context is a process that occurs in the rendering of a web page. It determines where the boxes are laid out. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block. Read More: Block Formatting Contexts in CSS"
What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?	"Elements with ""clear: "" will appear beneath a floated element, rather than next to them. Clear: none Clear: Left Clear: right (or both) Read More: MDN: clear"
Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.	Websites often deal with tons of images, but a lot of image requests add up and reduces the performance of your website. So instead of having to load a ton of images, you can sprite images by quilting together multiple images into one large image. This way multiple image requests can become a singular HTTP request. Then in the CSS you use background-position and background-repeat:no repeat to shift the background underneath so different sections are revealed. Commonly used for icons. Read More: An Easy Guide to CSS Sprites
How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?	If it’s only one browser, then I’d consider a separate stylesheet for that browser in particular. If I’m using bootstrap, then that has some libraries that can help fix browser specific styling issues. Beyond that I’d probably consider using a CSS Reset/Normalize depending on the styling issue.

How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?	Graceful degradation — The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers. Progressive enhancement — The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it. caniuse.com or Modernizr can also work Read More: MDN: Graceful degradation MDN: Progressive Enhancement
What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?	"Avoid using visibility:hidden and display:none as most screen-readers skip over this content. Generally for screen-readers you’d want to use the CSS class for only screen readers (typically '.sr-only' but name doesn’t matter). The following CSS will place it off-screen and hide the content inside. Read More: Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users"
Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?	I’ve used both CSS Grid and Flexbox. Often I’ll be using both. CSS Grid for the outer layout of the webpage so you can build a complex responsive design, and flexbox for aligning the content and moving blocks. If I had to pick one I prefer flexbox, but flexbox can’t do everything grid does and grid can’t do everything flexbox does. So it’s really just what tool is most relevant for the issue on hand.

Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?	A popular philosophy is to use mobile-first design, where the website is formatted for viewing on a phone and then media queries are used for larger screen sizes. Read More: What is Mobile First Design?
Are you familiar with styling SVG?	SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a series of instructions that tell a web browser what each image looks like. Especially since more and more people are using devices with Retina screens, SVG are important to avoid pixelation of images. Depending on the SVG, it’ll have different geometry properties, like cx/cy or rx/ry, height/width. They have some shared CSS, like the fill property, font properties, etc. Read More: Styling SVG with CSS
Can you give an example of an @media property other than screen?	Most common are: all — for all media typesprint — for printersscreen — for computer screens, tablets and, smart-phonesspeech — for screen readers that “read” the page out loud Read More: 7 Media types Media Query CSS Tutorial
"What are some of the ""gotchas"" for writing efficient CSS?"	"Shorter selectors are always ideal when possible. Avoid tag (div{}) and universal (*{})selectors as they match a large amount of elements. Ensure media queries are more specific than the base styling or they won't change the element. Avoid using shorthands (padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px) if possible. Causes issues with overlapping declarations. Read More:"
What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?	The main advantage is flexibility. Having access to variables and functions makes development much easier and results in a lot more readable CSS. Preprocessers can also create browser-specific CSS (webkit, moz-) automatically. As well being able to separate CSS in multiple files without worrying about extra HTTP requests. However, CSS preprocessors generally increase file size, and can take a long time to compile. There may also be errors in the compiling itself that can be difficult to debug. Those are the main disadvantages. Read More:
Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.	[Personal answer, edit here] Read More: 10 CSS Preprocessors Worth Considering
How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?	Web Design Comps (Comprehensives) are mockups for clients and web designers to get a clear consensus idea of what the website looks. If using @font-faces fonts can be downloaded when the page is accessed. I’d also look into web-safe fonts and how that could change the mockup to ensure that there’s workable fallbacks. Read More: How to Add Non-Standard Fonts to a Website
Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.	The browser starts at the rightmost selector and traverses up the parent elements to determine a match for multiple selectors. So for <p> <span> it first searches for all <span> in a page and then searches for <p> to confirm if it matches or not. Read More: Why do browsers match CSS selectors from right to left?
Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.	They help style parts of the div/text. The browser acts as if a whole new HTML element is added to the markup. Can be used for clearfixes, help with spacing, or decorate the first letter/line like a fancy book. MUST have a “content” property. Read More: ::before / ::after
Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.	The box model is the perspective that everything in CSS has a box around it. It’s the content area defined by the width. Different browsers all have their own way on how to render those boxes and what should be included in the “content” area. Read More: The CSS Box Model
What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?	The main advantage is you can specify dimensions of your elements without having to do any major calculations. It essentially counts the border in the width of the box itself. With border-box, the following is 100px wide. -- width: 100px; border: 2px solid black; -- Without border-box, it would be 102px wide and could mess up layout. Read More: box-sizing
What is the CSS display property and can you give a few examples of its use?	The display CSS property sets whether an element is a block or inline element. It also sets the layout for the children of said element. So there’s inline-block, block, inline, table, etc for the layout of an element on a page. There’s also display: flex, for the flex-boxes, where you can align-items and justify-content to influence the spacing of children elements. Some others include: display: inherit for inheriting the parent display property, display: initial, display: grid and display:none, etc Read More: MDN: display
